#Hirst Dot Painting Project


Modeled after a Damien Hirst 'dot' painting extracted from a scene in Marvel's Black Panther film. 
Specifically, this would be the scene where T'Challa visits the Djalia (the Wakandan afterlife) to speak to his father. I really like the aesthetic of that scene, and was using it to practice with the Turtle Module in Python.

##Usage
```python
import colorgram
    used this module to extract colors from the source image
import Turtle
    used this module to draw the end result
```

##Purpose
This project was primarily to get more experience with importing modules, OOP, and further expanding my understanding of the Python language
