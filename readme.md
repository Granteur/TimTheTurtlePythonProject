#Python Turtle Practice

##This project was just my first attempt at practicing drawing shapes with Python's Turtle module and get some practice with importing modules along with reviewing Turtle documentation

In its current state, running the program will cause the turtle (tim) to draw several regular shapes along with randomizing tim's color:

*Triangle               3	
*Square                 4
*Pentagon	            5
*Hexagon                6
*Septagon	            7
*Octagon                8
*Nonagon                9
*Decagon                10
*Undecagon              11
*Dodecagon              12
*Triskaidecagon         13	 	
*Tetrakaidecagon        14	 	
*Pentadecagon           15	 	
*Hexakaidecagon         16	 	
*Heptadecagon           17	 	
*Octakaidecagon         18	 	
*Enneadecagon           19	 	
*Icosagon               20
